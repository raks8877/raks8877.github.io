<!-- What is recursion -->
    <b id="what_is_recursion">What is Recursion?</b><br />
    Mirrors are the best way to explain what is recursion. If we place two mirrors 
    on opposite ends of an object, the resultant reflection we see on the mirror is recursion. 
    <br /><br />
    Below you can see an example taken from  the movie "Inception" by Christopher Nolan.

    In terms of Computer Programing, we perform recursion for functions. 
    A function consists of sets of instructions to accomplish a task. 
    We cannot perform infinite recursion in computers due to limitations such as memory. 
    Therefore we need some conditions to stop. We call such conditions “Base Condition”.

    <br /><br />

    Let’s take a simple example to understand. Write a program to return the sum of numbers from 1 to n. 

    <br /><br />
    <table class="center" >
        <tr >
            <th>
                Code
            </th>
            <th>
                Visual
            </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="/images/recursion/basic_recursion_code.png" alt="Recursion_Code">
                </td>
            <td>
                    <img src="/images/recursion/basic_recursion_visual.png" alt="Recursion_visual">
            </td>
            
        </tr>
    </table>
    

    On the right side, the visual contains the recursion pattern for the given program on the left.
    Down arrow represents the recursion. Up arrow represents the recursion’s return value. 
    Finally, at the top, the left arrow shows the final value return from the function.
